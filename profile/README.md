## This is the public profile for this hackathon project

### Project Description
This project intends to build a system where users from countries under [OCS](https://osc.int/)(and more) get microloans by utilizing blockchain technology with XRP Ledger. Users are prompted to sign up, enter vital information, and be offered different loans once their data is confirmed. Users will also get new accounts on XRP Ledger which will be the key points of transactions. Loans to users from around the world will receive loans through these accounts which will be converted and transferred to bank accounts of their choice.


## Here are features planned to be included in this system

### 1. Lending feature
This is the core feature of the system. The entity is given an interface to create loan offers with descriptions of amount, interest, and duration. Every user will check for and accept these offers. Once accepted the amount is transferred to the users and they are expected to pay, including the interest amount, within the time frame given.

### 2. Implementation of Blockchain.
The system is built on top of XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain tech which in our case is used for transactions between the users' accounts and the system's account. This makes the system accessible to users worldwide without having the differences in currencies as blockers.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Upon approval of a user's information, documents, and an initial payment(*more explanations on this below*), the system creates an account on the XRP ledger for that user. Transactions are made through these accounts.

### 3. Offline Support
Although internet/data is necessary to connect the client apps within our system, specifically for making transactions, we look forward to implementing a USSD technology to give the user an offline experience for as many features as possible. We also plan to show details of one's loan with interest calculations made on the phone in case of low or no data connectivity. This will later get refreshed when there is internet connection.

### 4. Language support
